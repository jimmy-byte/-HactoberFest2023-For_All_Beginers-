She is also capable of keeping a cool head during a crisis like, during a bus hijacking, she never fell out of her role as Jodie Saintemillion. The ease with which she's come to trust Conan's capabilities, at times unquestioningly following his direction despite the fact he looks like a little boy to her, indicates she can be quite open-minded and flexible, although a caveat to this is made in regards to Vermouth. Jodie's grudge against Vermouth runs deep, and Jodie reacted extremely negatively when given the slightest suggestion that Vermouth might have a kind side to her.
